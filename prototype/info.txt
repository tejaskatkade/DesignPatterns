Prototype Design Pattern
A Creational design pattern

If you are creating a object and while creating that object a complex logic is executing
so creating that object again and again is costly

Insted do not create object that object from scrach
we can use clonning

So the concept is to copy the existing object rather than creating new instance from scrach
This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when object creation is heavy process.
