In factory design pattern while creating object when object contais many attributes then there are many problems.
    1)  This problem is due to passing many parameters in constructor
    2)  If some parameters are optional then need to create            multiple constructor
    3) Factory class takes all responsibility for creating object. Then all complexity is of factory class.

so in Builder object is created step by step and finally return final object with desired values of attributes.

Helpful in creating Immutable object

note: in way_1 and way_2 there is no such  difference
way_1 : Object is create in client class.
way_2 : using static method to create object
